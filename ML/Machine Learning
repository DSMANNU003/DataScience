Machine Learning a part of  Data Science.
Standard Machine Learning has two parts:
1) Supervised Learning
2) Unsupervised learning
3) Reinforcement Learning
We should have a knowledge of Mathematics to learn machine learning:- Statistics, linear algebra, Probability, Differential calculas(optimization algorithm), Permutation & combinations
